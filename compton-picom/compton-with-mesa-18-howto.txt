Compton with mesa 18.x is broken.

From this url (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=897659), someone suggest a possible solution:

Setting these config settings under ~/.config/compton.conf allows compton to work properly again

backend = "xr_glx_hybrid";
glx-no-stencil = false;
glx-no-rebind-pixmap = false;
glx-copy-from-front = false;
glx-use-copysubbuffermesa = false;
vsync = "none";
glx-swap-method = "0";
resize-damage = false;
paint-on-overlay = true;
unredir-if-possible = false;


Note: not all of these are required, I left vsync on and it still fixed the issue


Other possible solutions:

allow_rgb10_configs = false

There are a compton fork that appears to be more mantained and it is working better:
